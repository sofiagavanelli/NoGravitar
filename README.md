# NoGravitar  
## About  
NoGravitar is a reproduction (not completely accurate) of vector graphics arcade game Gravitar, released by Atari, Inc. in 1982.  

## How to play  
Rotating the spaceship is possible using right and left arrows, while to move in the chosen direction you can press the up button (it is also possible to accellerate thanks to it)  or the down one. The spacebar is used to open fire towards the bunkers and the tab button is necessary to pick up fuel for the spaceship.
